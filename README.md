# xpmgr
Command line interface for Windows XP license management, inspired by Microsoft's "slmgr".

## Usage
`--GetProductID`: Gets the product ID (ex: `76477-755-3803223-21229`).

`--SetProductKey`: Sets the product key (tested to work with dashes).

`--GetInstallationID`: Gets an Installation ID with **no dashes** (ex: `253286028742154311079061239762245184619981623171292574`). 

`--SetConfirmationID`: Sets a Confirmation ID (tested to work with dashes).

Make sure you do commands right, since, as of now, there's no checking to make sure it's correct or not!
